        <h3 id="whatis">What is Islamophobia?</h3>
        <p>Often times today we fall to the common misconception that in our age hate crimes aren't as much of a problem as they were in the past
        on the contrary, hate crimes have gotten worse and become more frequent as the years go by.<br>
        According to the latest statistics provided by the FBI in 2017 <span class="important"><em>"In 2017, 16,149 law enforcement agencies participated in the Hate Crime Statistics Program.
        Of these agencies, 2,040 reported 7,175 hate crime incidents involving 8,437 offenses"</em></span></p>
        <p><strong>What exactly is the definition of Islamophobia?</strong><br>Islamophobia is a fear towards Muslims, a result of the attack on 9/11 since 
        9/11 was lead by a terrorist group run by Muslims. After that attack fear spread across America and people feared that any Muslim could be the next
        big terrorist or cause the next big catastrophe</p>
        <p><strong>What are the characteristics of Islamophobia</strong><br>Islamophobics typically compare Muslims to terrorist, Islamophobics live under the
        impression that all Muslims are or could be a terrorist. The result of this idea is often racism and discrimination directed towards Muslims.</p>

            <li>A lot of hate comes in from the media so combat the media by spreading positivity and combatting the hate online</li>
            <li>"If you see something say something" definitely applies to acts of hate, if you see someone getting attacked, be the intervention or drive the attacker away</li>

        <div style="text-align:right;"><p style="line-height:2em;">As you can see in the data, before 2001 anti-Muslim hate crimes haven't been as prevalent. At 2001 anti-Muslim hate crimes spiked probably due to the 9/11 attack, thankfully
        after that the numbers settled a bit, but they never dropped to pre-9/11 numbers. From 2015 the amount of crimes begins to increase again maybe because of the age of technology and 
        media. The media has also helped spread anti-Muslim themes across the nation.<br><em>Source of data is released data from FBI</em></p></div>

         other religious based hate crimes. The data shows that anti-Muslim hate crimes take up a large amount of that, the largest is anti-Semitic but the percentage of
         anti-Muslim is still pretty large<br><em>Source of data is released data from FBI</em></p></div>
