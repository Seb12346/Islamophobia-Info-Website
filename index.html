        <div id="whatis">
        <h3>What is Islamophobia?</h3>
        <p>To put it simply, Islamophobia is the fear and hatred of Muslims. In the modern-day, it is the fear that is known to associate Muslims with 
        terrorists due to the attack on 9/11. The worst Islamophobics discriminate against or keep away from Muslims because of the assumption 
        that all Muslims are or can be terrorists. Islamophobia is, like other hate crimes, everywhere, in the media, on the streets, everywhere.
        Like other acts of hate, there may be violence, discrimination against the group, prejudice and stigmas.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="when">
        <h3>When did the anti-Muslim attacks start?</h3>
        <p>It’s important to take note that anti-Muslim hate crimes have been around since before 9/11 (see statistics), in fact it has probably been
         around since the religion was founded. However, the anti-Muslim hate crime count spiked in 2001 after the attack on 9/11, and 
         though the year after the numbers dropped, over the past couple of years the number of anti-Muslim hate crimes in the year has begun to rise.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="how9-11">
        <h3>Where does 9/11 fit in all this?</h3>
        <p>The attacks on 9/11 were lead by a terrorist group based in Afghanistan called “al-Qaeda”. The group is run by, you guessed it, 
        Muslims. After the attack terror spread across the United States and the fact that such an attack was lead by a group of Muslims lead
         people to conclude that all Muslims must be associated with terrorists in some way, whether they are or are related to or have 
        contact with terrorists.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="signs">
        <h3>What are the signs? How can I tell if an Islamophobic attack is happening?</h3>
        <p>Islamophobia has more or less the same characteristics as your average hate-driven attack except it is directed to Muslims 
        and people who share traits that are typically associated with the stereotypical Muslim. Often verbal attacks involve calling 
        Muslims out for being terrorists though they probably aren’t. </p>
        </div>
    
        <div id="today">
        <h3>Modern Day Islamophobia</h3>
        <p>Here are a few examples of some events which happened as a result of Islamophobia</p>  
        <ul>
          <li>During his term President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13769, also known as "Protecting the nation from Foreign Terrorist 
           Entry into the United States". It prohibited the entry of refugees into the U.S. for 120 days and visitors from some Muslim countries
           could not enter for 90 days. Though there were certain exceptions (people with some bona fide relationship in the U.S. who could get
           a greencard) still received prejudice and discrimination from people working in the Transportation Security Administration and 
           Customs & Border Control Officers</li> 
          <li>On March 15, 2019 a 28-year old Australian shot up two mosques in New Zealand. He also allegedly published a racist manifesto
           online prior to the attack in New Zealand</li>
          <li>As for something a little closer to today, about a month ago(as of October 2019), at an anti-Islamophobia event a man allegedly
           attacked two Muslim women and some of the security at the venue with a knife, thankfully no one was harmed. Considering this was done in an anti-Islamophobia event
           it was probably an Islamophobic act. The police are still investigating at the moment</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Fighting Islamophobia -->
        <h3 id="fight">Fighting Islamophobia</h3>
        <p>There's quite a bit you can do to contribute to fighting Islamophobia, here is a list of some things you can do to help combat these hate-driven acts</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Support groups like CAIR who do what they can to combat Islamophobia, no need to join, just support<br>
            <img id="img1" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3c/CAIR_logo.svg/1200px-CAIR_logo.svg.png" width="300" alt="CAIR logo">
            </li>
            <li>Put positivity out in the media, unfortunately, today the media is a very easy way to spread ideas and allow them to grow or spread to the minds of others. 
            We can use this to our advantage by putting out good content which embraces Muslims and portrays them as the non-terrorists that they probably are</li>
            <li>If you see something, say something <em>and</em> do something. If you see someone verbally abusing a Muslim or attacking them or calling them out as a terrorist, report 
            it and if you think you can, intervene and defuse the situation. If someone has vandalized a Muslim’s property and called them a terrorist, report it
             and maybe help to clean up the mess.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are among many ways to put up a fight against Islamophobia, we can all contribute different amounts so let's all pitch in what we can
        so that we can help</p>

        <div style="text-align:right;"><p style="line-height:2em;">As you can see in the data, before 2001 anti-Muslim hate crimes haven't been as prevalent. At 2001 anti-Muslim hate crimes spiked probably due to the 9/11 attack, thankfully
        after that the numbers settled a bit, but they never dropped to pre-9/11 numbers. From 2015 the amount of crimes begins to increase again maybe because of the age of technology and 
        media. The media has also helped spread anti-Muslim themes across the nation.<br><em>Source of data is released data from FBI</em></p></div>

          is still pretty large<br><em>Source of data is released data from FBI</em></p></div>
